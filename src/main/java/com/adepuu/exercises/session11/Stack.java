     * Write a Java stack program that can scale dynamically
     * <p>
     * As a developer, I want to implement a Java stack program that can scale dynamically using a linked list, so that I can efficiently manage data storage and retrieval in my applications.
     * Notes:
     * The program doesn't require a menu system; focus should be on data structure implementation.
     * <p>
     * Acceptance Criteria:
     * - Functionality: The program must be able to perform basic stack operations (push, pop, peek) on a linked list.
     * - Dynamic Scaling: The stack should automatically scale in size as elements are added or removed, without any manual resizing required by the user.
     * - Performance: The program should maintain constant time complexity for push and pop operations, ensuring efficient data management.
     * - Memory Efficiency: The stack should use memory efficiently, allocating and deallocating memory dynamically as needed.
     * - Error Handling: The program should handle edge cases gracefully, such as attempting to pop an element from an empty stack, and provide clear error messages.
