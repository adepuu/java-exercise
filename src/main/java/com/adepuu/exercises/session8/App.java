     *
     * <h3>Task Management:</h3>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Given a logged-in user, when they input a new task through the console, then the system should add the task to their to-do list and confirm the task has been added.</li>
     *     <li>Given a logged-in user, when they view their to-do list through the console, then the system should display all tasks currently in their list.</li>
     *     <li>Given a logged-in user, when they input a task to delete through the console, then the system should remove the task from their to-do list and confirm the task has been deleted.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h3>Other:</h3>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>When a user accesses the application, the interface should display a clear and concise menu with options to add a task, view tasks, delete a task, or log out, all accessible through the console.</li>
